## Standard Java REST API: Introduction to JAX-RS
JAX-RS is a standard Java REST API, which has been widely supported and applied in the industry. 
Among them, there are many well-known open source framework implementations, including Oracle's Jersey,
RedHat's RestEasy, Apache's CXF and Wink, and restlet. In addition, 
all commercial JavaEE application servers that support JavaEE 6.0 and above provide support for JAX-RS. 
Therefore, JAX-RS is a very mature solution, and there is no so-called vendor lock-in problem with it.

## JAX-RS Supported

smart-doc currently supports scanning some frameworks implemented using the Jaxrs specification to generate restfulAPI documents, 
such as Quarkus. However, due to limited energy, the functions developed are not yet perfect. 
We will find time in the follow-up to improve the support for the Jaxrs specification.
